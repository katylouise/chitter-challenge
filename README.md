# Chitter

A Twitter-style app built using Ruby, Sinatra and DataMapper ORM. Tested with RSpec and Capybara.

## Getting Started

```
git clone https://github.com/katylouise/chitter-challenge.git
cd chitter-challenge
bundle install
rackup
```
Go to localhost:9292

## Running Tests

To run rspec:
```
rspec
```

## Learning
* One of the main challenges with this project was creating a Sinatra app in the modular style.  I struggled with this during the weekly project, but felt much more confident with structuring my app after making Chitter.
* This project also taught me about relational databases and how to use an ORM such as DataMapper.
